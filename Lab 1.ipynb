    "The mean salary for the city of Seattle has been found to be 39.59 dollars per hour. We also found that the lowest earning employee in the City of Seattle payroll is Amy Bonfrisco who earns 5.53 dollars an hour, and the highest earning employee is Mami Hara who earns 137.79 dollars per hour. These values have been rounded to the nearest hundredth. Areas for further exploration include other employees who have the same salary, why the mayor does not have the highest salary, what about being the role of GM and CEO of SPU makes it such a lucrative position (one possible theory is retention concerns between the public and private sectors). Also, how is wage of less than the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour possible? What about that specific position allows for a well below minimum wage?"
